介紹(Introduction):
這是我在剛學c語言時所寫的飛機戰鬥遊戲，放上github作為紀錄
裡面的程式碼沒有修改過，留著看自己的成長
This is a simple project use "c" to implement a computer game 

Requirements:
- windows7(I didn't test on other windows OS version,but I think that all windows OS can work.)
- make sure you have all library I included.(especially "pthread.h")

how to compile:
I recommend to use IDE to compile this program,especially dev_c++.
Because when you install dev_c++, you will also install all library you need.
It can help you save a lot of time for setting up your enviroment.
